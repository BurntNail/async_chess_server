# Async Chess Server

This is a server for an asynchronous game of Chess. The client is written in Rust, but I wanted to write a server in Go to get more Go experience. If you're running this yourself, make sure to add a `.env` file with a variable for `DB_PASSWORD` and to change the server ip in `main.go`
